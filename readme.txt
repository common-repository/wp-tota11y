WP Tota11y is an accessibility visualization toolkit.

== Description ==

WP Tota11y helps visualize how your site performs with assistive technologies. Check out the [Tota11y webpage](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/).
The process of testing for accessibility (a11y) is often tedious and confusing. In many cases, developers must have some prior accessibility knowledge in order to make sense of the results.
Instead, tota11y aims to reduce this barrier of entry by helping visualize accessibility violations (and successes), while educating on best practices.

= How it works =

WP Tota11y is a single JavaScript file that inserts a small button in the bottom corner of your document.
The toolbar consists of several plugins that each provide their own functionality.
Many of these plugins "annotate" elements on the page. Sometimes to show their existence, other times to point out when something's wrong.

= Compatibility =

This plugin is compatible with [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net).

This plugin is also available in [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cyclotouriste/wp-tota11y).
